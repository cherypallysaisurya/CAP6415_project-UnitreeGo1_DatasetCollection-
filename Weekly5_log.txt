What I Accomplished This Week

Week 5 focused on finalizing the dataset format following industry best practices (KITTI, nuScenes), discovering the dual return mode in the LiDAR data, and preparing for project submission.

Technical Implementation

1. Dataset Format Research

Researched industry-standard dataset formats:
- KITTI: Binary point clouds [x, y, z, reflectance] as float32, separate timestamp files
- nuScenes: Relational database with calibration and sensor metadata

Decision: Adopted KITTI-style binary format for compatibility with existing tools.

2. DUAL RETURN Discovery

Major finding: The RoboSense Helios-16 is operating in DUAL RETURN mode.

Previous understanding:
- Thought: 16 measurements per block (one per laser beam)
- Result: ~6,600 points per frame

Actual structure discovered:
- Reality: 32 measurements per block (16 beams × 2 returns)
- Measurements 0-15: STRONGEST return for each beam
- Measurements 16-31: LAST return for each beam
- Result: ~13,600 points per frame (2x more data!)

Proof from packet analysis:
```
Block 0 Analysis:
  Beam 0: Strongest=5.069m, Last=5.095m (26mm difference)
  Beam 1: Strongest=1.026m, Last=0.949m (77mm difference)
```

3. extract_dataset_v2.py Created

New KITTI-style extraction script with:
- DUAL RETURN support (extracts both strongest and last returns)
- Binary .bin files: Nx5 float32 [x, y, z, intensity_norm, return_type]
- Raw CSV backup for verification
- Timestamp files (Unix epoch, 6 decimal places)
- Calibration placeholder file
- Auto-generated README per session

4. Combined CSV Creation

Created single unified dataset file:
- Filename: dataset_combined.csv
- Size: 4.9 GB
- Rows: 44,311,369 LiDAR points
- Columns: session, frame_index, camera_timestamp_ms, camera_file, 
           packet_timestamp, beam, return_type, azimuth_raw, distance_raw, intensity

All values are TRUE RAW sensor values - nothing synthetic or assumed.

5. Dataset Statistics

Final dataset:
| Session | Location | Frames | LiDAR Points |
|---------|----------|--------|--------------|
| 20251206_132136 | 4th Floor Hallway | 576 | 7,870,298 |
| 20251206_154822 | 4th Floor Lounge | 535 | 7,468,838 |
| 20251206_161536 | 5th Floor Hallway | 737 | 9,764,524 |
| 20251206_162223 | 3rd Floor Hallway | 955 | 12,993,901 |
| 20251207_112819 | Mlab | 505 | 6,213,808 |
| TOTAL | | 3,308 | 44,311,369 |

6. Demo Scripts Created

- show_sample_data.py: Displays sample camera frame and LiDAR statistics
- simple_model_demo.py: Train/test split (80/20) demonstration

Train/Test Split Results:
- Train: 4 sessions (2,803 frames, 84.7%)
- Test: 1 session - Mlab (505 frames, 15.3%)
- Consistency: Test set shows similar characteristics to training set

Key Learnings

1. Always verify raw data format - the dual return mode was hidden in the packet structure
2. Industry-standard formats (KITTI) improve compatibility and reproducibility
3. TRUE RAW VALUES are essential - avoid any transformations that can't be verified
4. Backup raw data in human-readable format (CSV) alongside binary for verification
