Weekly Log — Week 1 (ending 2025-11-09)

Name: Sai Surya Cherupally
Project: Dataset Creation using Unitree Go1 Robot

---

What I Did This Week

* Explored methods to collect sensor data from the Unitree Go1 robot (LiDAR and camera).
* Learned how to connect to the robot and fetch streaming sensor data.
* Tested LiDAR recordings to capture surrounding geometry and validated camera image capture.
* Began designing an interface to automate data collection workflows.
* Investigated best practices for storing and organizing sensor data for future research use.

Challenges

* Understanding LiDAR data storage and conversion (e.g., working with .pcap files).
* Synchronizing LiDAR and camera capture so both sensors record simultaneously.

---

Plan for Next Week

* Implement a simple script to simultaneously collect LiDAR and camera data.
* Ensure sensor timestamps are recorded for synchronization.
* Collect a small sample dataset to validate end-to-end capture and storage.
